The Sunshine Prevention Center (https://www.sunshinepreventionctr.org/) currently presents users of their website
with interactive features such as games, puppetry, and online storybooks.
We seek to provide additional opportunities for the Sunshine Prevention Center to reach out to children
by digitizing their Student Workbook and designing an online platform featuring activities such as
a moral dilemma maze, emotion identification flower fill-ins, and friendship building exercises
 -- intended to aid children in the process of learning about their feelings and building social skills.
The e-Workbook will utilize images and text inspired and sourced from the physical workbook given out to students involved with the program.
